        For centuries, engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into
        manufacture. In recent decades some methods have comme into commerce, called model-based definition (MBD) or
        digital product definition (DPD). Today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured
        component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing.<br /><b style="padding-left: 50px"> </b>
        It still takes CAD/CAM programmers, CNC setup workers, and CNC operators to do manufacturing, as
        well as other people such as quality assurance staff (inspectors) and logistics staff (for materials
        handling, shipping-and-receiving, and front office functions). These workers often use drawings in the
        course of their work that have been produced from the dataset. When proper procedures are being
        followed, a clear chain of precedence is always documented.
