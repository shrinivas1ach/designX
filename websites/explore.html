        Technical drawing has existed since ancient times. Modern engineering drawing, with its
        precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale, arose in France at a time when the Industrial
        Revolution was in its infancy. It helped British engineering technique much greater exent than the machines they
        represented before. The art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing.
        For centuries, until the post-World War II era, all engineering drawing was done manually by using
        pencil and pen on paper or other substrate. Since the advent of computer-aided
        design (CAD), engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each
        passing decade. Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not
        entirely disappeared.<br /><br /><b style="padding-left: 50px;">TOOLS:  </b>
        Some of the manual drafting tools include pencils, pens and their ink, straightedges, T-squares,
        French curves, triangles, rulers, protractors, dividers, compasses, scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins.And of course the tools also include
        drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables.Drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards,
        straightedges, pantographs, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.<br /><br />
        <b style="padding-left: 50px;">PROJECTIONS:  </b> They are basically the viwes of an object as it looks from the front, right, left, top, bottom,
        or back.<br /> In First-angle projection, the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from behind and
        pass through the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane behind it. The 3D object is projected into 2D "paper" space as
        if you were looking at a radiograph of the object: the top view is under the front view, the right view is at the left of the front view.
        First-angle projection is the ISO standard and is primarily used in Europe.<br />
        In Third-angle projection, the parallel projectors originate as if radiated from the far side of the object and pass through the 3D object to
        project a 2D image onto the orthogonal plane in front of it. The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes
        the object, and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing. Thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and
        the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third-angle projection is primarily used in the United
        states and Canada.<br /><br />
        <b style="padding-left: 50px;">Graphic sheet:  </b> Almost all engineering drawings communicate, not only with the help of geometrical shapes but also with
        dimensions and tolerances. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. Coordinate dimensioning involves defining all points, lines,
        planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Drawings convey the critical information such as dimensions,tolerances,
        geomertry, and material of the object drawn.<br /><br />
        <b style="padding-left: 50px;">Lines:  </b> A variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects. Types of lines include the following:
        visible –  continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle. Hidden –  short-dashed lines used to represent edges that
        are not directly visible. Center – alternately long- and short-dashed lines used to represent the axes of circular features.
        Section- thin lines in a pattern used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from "cutting". Cutting-plane - thin, medium-dashed lines,
        or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for section views.
