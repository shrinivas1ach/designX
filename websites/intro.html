        <b style="padding-left: 50px"> </b>Engineering drawing, most commonly referred to as engineering graphics, is the art of manipulation of designs of
        a variety of components, especially those related to engineering. It primarily consists of sketching the actual component, for example a machine,
        with its exact dimensions. The scale of dimensions is suitably adjusted so as to properly fit within the contours of the drawing sheet.<br />
        <br />In some cases, depending in the discipline, there are areas of particular focus, such as in the case of Structural Engineering.
        Another consideration is in regards to the units of measure used; these could be not only Metric or Imperial, but also the way
        these are noted is relevant, because it will also reflect the precision of a dimension.<br /><br />
        An engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing that is used to convey information about an object. A common use is to specify
        the geometry necessary for the construction of a component and is called a detail drawing. Usually, a number of drawings are necessary
        to completely specify even a simple component. The drawings are linked together by a master drawing or assembly drawing which gives the
        drawing numbers of the subsequent detailed components, quantities required, construction materials and possibly 3D images that can be used
        to locate individual items. Although mostly consisting of pictographic representations, abbreviations and symbols are used for brevity and
        additional textual explanations may also be provided to convey the necessary information.<br /><br />
        <b style="padding-left: 50px"> </b>Drawings typically contain multiple
        views of a component, the information that is a requirement is typically specified. Key information such as dimensions is usually only
        specified in one place on a drawing, avoiding redundancy and the possibility of inconsistency. Drawings have an information box or title block
        containing who drew the drawing, who approved it, units of dimensions, meaning of views, the title of the drawing and the drawing number.
