            <b style="padding-left: 50px"> </b>Engineering drawing, most commonly referred to as engineering graphics, is the art of manipulation of designs of
            a variety of components, especially those related to engineering. It primarily consists of sketching the actual component, for example a machine,
            with its exact dimensions. The scale of dimensions is suitably adjusted so as to properly fit within the contours of the drawing sheet.<br />
            <br />In some cases, depending in the discipline, there are areas of particular focus, such as in the case of Structural Engineering.
            Another consideration is in regards to the units of measure used; these could be not only Metric or Imperial, but also the way
            these are noted is relevant, because it will also reflect the precision of a dimension.

        <p class="align">
            Drawings typically contain multiple
            views of a component, the information that is a requirement is typically specified. Key information such as dimensions is usually only
            specified in one place on a drawing, avoiding redundancy and the possibility of inconsistency. Drawings have an information box or title block
            containing who drew the drawing, who approved it, units of dimensions, meaning of views, the title of the drawing and the drawing number.

            Technical drawing has existed since ancient times. Modern engineering drawing, with its
            precise conventions of orthographic projection and scale, arose in France at a time when the Industrial
            Revolution was in its infancy. It helped British engineering technique much greater exent than the machines they
            represented before. The art of presenting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane which we now call mechanical drawing.
            For centuries, until the post-World War II era, all engineering drawing was done manually by using
            pencil and pen on paper or other substrate. Since the advent of computer-aided
            design (CAD), engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each
            passing decade. Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not
            entirely disappeared.<br /><br />
            With the advent of computer generated drawings for manufacturing and machining, many symbols have
            fallen out of common use.As in many technical fields, a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in
            engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries. For example, cold rolled steel is often
            abbreviated as CRS, and diameter is often abbreviated as DIA, D, or ⌀.

            For centuries, engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into
            manufacture. In recent decades some methods have comme into commerce, called model-based definition (MBD) or
            digital product definition (DPD). Today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured
            component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing.<br /><b style="padding-left: 50px"> </b>
